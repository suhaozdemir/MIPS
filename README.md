# MIPS
- This project compares two array values and creates new array with the bigger ones.
- I used MARS Assembler to assemble the code. You can get it from [here](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

## Example
> Array one elements = [2,8,3,9,3,1,4,0,9,2,5,6,8,2,3,6,4,8,4,5,0,9,7,1,3,7,3,6,8,2]
>
> Array two elements = [7,2,7,4,8,2,6,3,5,8,0,1,2,7,5,3,9,5,3,8,5,0,4,3,7,5,2,8,9,1]

The program compares this two array indices and returns the bigger ones in Array three.

> Array three elements = [7,8,7,9,8,2,6,3,9,8,5,6,8,7,5,6,9,8,4,8,5,9,7,3,7,7,3,8,9,2]
